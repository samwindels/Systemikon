# Systemikon/LIST
This folder contains code to create lists of gene identifiers for gene-pair annotation by the systemikon annotation tracks.

# Introduction
The List 2.0.py file exists to convert a given list into KEGG ID and Gene Symbols.

# Requirements
- Python
- urllib2 and json libraries (should be default)

#Genome - xxxx.txt
Homo sapiens lists in varying formats, tab delimited, to be used for analysis.

#input.txt
Sample input file.
The input is simply one line with a run identifier, one blank line, and then the list of genes to be converted on new lines:
Run00000

Gene01
Gene02
Gene03

#output.txt
This is the output file that will be edited, or added if it doesnâ€™t exist. Make sure you rename each output as the code will simply overwrite this current file.

#Setup:
- Place your data in the input.txt file as needed.
- Open List 2.0.py and run it.
- Output should be in the output.txt file.

#To Do
- [ ] Change the output file from overwriting to creating a new file each time.
