V 1.1
2015-04-30
-------------------------------


The LIST format defines the input format to the Systemikon workflow.
This is a plain text file.

A program is expected to stop with error if more than one metadata
record matching the same pattern is present.


Mandatory records:

  taxID: exactly one record required
    Format:
      taxID: <number>
      taxID: <number>  # comment
    Example:
      taxID: 9606
      taxID: 4932  # saccharomyces cerevisiae

Optional records:

  Comment:
    Lines that start with "#" will be discarded
    Format:
      # <string>
    Example:
      # Random test input

  Empty line:
    Lines that have no contents will be discarded
    Format:
      NA

  Gene set label:
    Contains label that will be passed down the workflow.
    Format:
      geneSetLabel:\\s*(\\S+)
      (string after keyword to first whitespace)
    Example:
      geneSetLabel: synth01

  Gene set description:
    Contains description that will be passed down the workflow.
    Format:
      geneSetDescription:\\s*([^#]+)
      (string after keyword to comment or end_of_line)
    Example:
      geneSetDescription: Yeast test: 200 genes, 7 systems, 2 supersystems
      geneSetDescription: Synthetic set: 1 gene, 2 systems  # Testcas

  Gene symbol or ID:
    the first element followed by whitespace on
    a line that does not contain recognized metadata
    or comment is assumed to be a gene symbol or
    gene id.
    This string must not contain ":" or "#".
    Format:
      ([^\s]+)
      (string from start of line to first whitespace)
    Example:
      KLF4
      9314  # entrez ID
