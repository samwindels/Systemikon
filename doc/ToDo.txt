 - Review of R-package requirements for CRAN or Bioconductor

 - LIST
   -  Refactoring for R (Done, but still stuff ToDo eg. whole
        organism lists)
   -  Define some gene sets for demo analysis
        (True Positives: pre-curated systems,
         "True" Negatives: random genes)
 - COEX
   - Review of code. 
   - Review of source data. I think the tissue data set is not optimal.
       Also, we don't have anything to work with non-human genes. The whole
       mess of selecting from GEO is not really solved. There must be better
       approaches.
   - Normalization still needs to be addressed. There is new work by Terrence Speed
     using factor analysis that looks interesting. He talked about it at the Fields
     seminar that Hareem had told us about and you all didn't go to  ;-)
     Essentially he believes that we CAN combine RNAseq and microarray data. If you
     are interested, see e.g. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25150836 
   - MIC is too slow for large lists. Pearson is probably oK. Can we make
     MIC substantially faster, and: is there actually a benefit of using MIC? (I.e.
     have we shown that there are genes of interest with low Pearson and high MIC?
     Can we perhaps compute a ROC curve to compare MIC and Pearson (from known true
     positives)?

 - INTERACT
   - Massive code-review required.
   - also: iRef has just released a DB update.
   - How to deal with the source data? The MITAB file is 793MB. We will
     need to figure out how to create the relevant subsets, organism specific,
     and load them only on demand. How do other bioconductor packages solve this
     problem.
   - Weighting needs to be improved - in fact, we don't yet have a model of how to
     make weights commensurable across tracts. 
   - Interologs? Should we add them?

 - PATHNE 
   - still too few hits. I believe Richard is already thinking about how to improve
     this.

 - GOSEM
   - I think we are pretty much oK here. But we might think about an improved
    algorithm to calculate semantic similarity in constant time.
   - Preprocessing of GOA data? 
   - The same concern about data-file size as for iRef apply?
   - What's a good strategy for updates? GOA is updated quite frequently...

 - TIE/WEAVE
   - oK, for now.
   - should review datamodel esp. re. metadata. 
   - Using a particular DB crreates a dependency that we may not like. Is it better
     better to just create R-objects, dump them as .rda files and do all processing
     in-memory?

 - FIND 
   - review algorithms and results.
   - potentially revise systems definition: do our clusters correspond to
        our original definition.
   - improve multigraph clustering in principle. Can we think of better approaches?
   - define cluster quality criteria
   - use (soft) hierarchical clustering
 
 - STAT  TBD
 - VIS  TBD

 - ... add numeric output
 - ... add sample runs.
