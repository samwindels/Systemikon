# Probability that a gene pair within a system
# shares an edge. The minimum should be calculated
# from Erdös-Rényi theory so as to ensure that
# the graph for the system is almost certainly
# connected. The required probability for an
# edge between a pair is log(n)/n where n is the
# System size: for 20,000 genes and 1,000 systems
# the average system size is 20 and pWithin is 0.1498
# The maximum would be for each system to be fully
# connected, i.e. pWithin is 1.0 
# For 20,000 genes and 1,000 systems, if
# each sytem is fully connected, it turns out the
# average node-degree is about 10. Coincidentally(?)
# that is also approximately the average number of 
# iREF annotations per human gene.

pBetween <- ((1 - pWithin) * meanDegree * nGenes) / 
            (((nGenes^2)-nGenes)/2)
# Probability that a gene pair between systems
# shares an edge.
# Of the total number of edges, the pWithin portion
# has been assigned within systems, the remainder
# are between-systems edges. A total of M <- ((x^2)-x)/2
# such edges are possible where x is the number of
# genes ... this is very much larger than the number
# of within-system edges. The probability of an edge
# pair is thus ((1-pWithin) * 10 * nGenes) / M ... or
# about 0.00085


baseWeight <- 0.8  # The basic weight for all tracks
baseSpread <- 2    # The spread for an Edge-tuple weight
betweenTracksSpread <- 2
threshold <- 0.1

# a tuple from baseWeight and baseSpread, then using this 
# probability as a basis, producing a random weight for each
# of the tracks according to the betweenTracksSpread.

# =================================================
# Part one: Determine system sizes:
# =================================================

# We use a preferential attachment model in which
# the probability of a gene attaching to a system
# depends on the system size.
# This is done through an energy-based model:
# the probability of a gene attaching to a system
# is taken as 1/nSystems. This is converted to a
# statistical free energy. Every additional gene 
# in a system decreases the energy by
# the same amount, and thus increases the probability
# of attaching a new gene and growing the system.
# Growth is pursued until all genes have been assigned
# to a system.

# The resulting distribution is approximately
# scale-free (linear on a log(rank) vs. log(size)) plot
